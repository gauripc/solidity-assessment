# MyToken Smart Contract

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract for a token called "MyToken." The contract includes functionality for minting and burning tokens. This README provides information on how to use, deploy, and contribute to the project.

## Features
1. Token Details: Public variables storing information about the token (name, symbol, total supply).
2. Balance Tracking: A mapping of addresses to balances is used to track token balances.
3. Mint Function: The contract includes a mint function that increases the total supply and the balance of the recipient.
4. Burn Function: The contract includes a burn function that decreases the total supply and the balance of the sender.

## Getting Started

1.	Deployment
   
Deploy the smart contract to a compatible Ethereum blockchain. You can use tools like Remix or frameworks like Truffle for deployment.
Interact with the deployed contract using your preferred Ethereum wallet or tool.

2.	Usage
   
Customize the contract as needed for your specific use case.
Implement additional functionality or integrate with other smart contracts if necessary.

3.	Testing
   
You can write and run tests using tools like Truffle or Hardhat.
